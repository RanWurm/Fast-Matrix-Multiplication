# Fast Marching Method (FMM) Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a C implementation of the Fast Marching Method (FMM), a numerical technique used primarily for solving the Eikonal equation and other related problems in computational geometry and physics. The FMM is used to model wave propagation and is particularly well-suited for problems involving moving interfaces.

## Features
- **Eikonal Solver**: Implements the FMM to solve the Eikonal equation accurately and efficiently.
- **Utilities**: Includes additional utility functions for matrix operations and other calculations that support FMM operations.
- **Modular Code**: The project is divided into multiple files to separate concerns and enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Project Structure
- `fmm.c`: The core implementation file for the Fast Marching Method.
- `fmm.h`: Header file for the FMM implementation, declaring functions and dependencies.
- `main.c`: The main entry point of the program, demonstrating the usage of the FMM.
- `utilities.c`: Contains auxiliary functions that aid in matrix manipulations and other tasks.
- `utilities.h`: Header file for the utilities provided in `utilities.c`.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run this project, you will need a C compiler (e.g., GCC). You can compile the project using the following commands:

```bash
gcc -o fmm main.c fmm.c utilities.c -lm
./fmm
Usage
The main.c file demonstrates how to set up the FMM and perform calculations. Modify this file to fit the specific requirements of your problem domain or to test different scenarios.

Example
Here is a basic example of how to use the FMM in a project:

c
Copy code
#include "fmm.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize problem-specific parameters
    // Call FMM solver
    // Process results
    return 0;
}
